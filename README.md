# Enron_SNA_and_Text_Mining

## Purpouse and objetive
In this notebook I am going to collect learned knowledge in the subject "Information search and analysis" from the 3rd year of Software Engineering.  
I am going to use Enron email dataset, but I am not going to work with all the data. I am going to analyse mails from 2001 onwards. Why this date? If we search some information about Enron, we can see that on December 3, 2001 they declared their bankruptcy, so I think it is a good portion of data to analyse.
